# Sample-calculator

This is a sample calculator project that performs basic arithmetic operations.

* Add
* Subtract
* Multiply
* Divide

Project is written in Golang.

I have created a calc package `calc/calc.go` that calculates and returns the result.

Also i have included `calc/calc_test.go` that returns the test result based on the expected output.

`go test`

I included created a go binary `Sample-calculator`, i.e, an executable file

`./sample-calculator`
